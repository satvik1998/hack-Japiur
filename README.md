There are numerous courses available online on platforms like Udemy, Coursera, Coding Blocks etc. from where students can learn how to program. However due to the overwhelmingly large number of choices available selecting one of them becomes difficult. To make a little difference in this procedure we have developed a website in which some of the best or highly rated courses from these platforms are shown. And after choosing a course the student we will be redirected to the website of the platfrom of which he or she wants to take the course.  In a nutshell the website acts a catalogue for courses available on various platforms.

To start the website follow the given steps:-
  1. **Python** should be installed on the system.
     If it is not yet installed, please install it from https://www.python.org
  
  2. Once Python is installed make sure **Django** is also installed on the system.
     If it is not installed then install it using the command - **pip install Django**
  
  3. Now clone the repository in the system.
  
  4. Open the terminal at the location where the repository has been cloned.
  
  5. Once you are inside the directory **hack-Jaipur/hackjaipur** start the server using the command :-
     **python manage.py runserver**
